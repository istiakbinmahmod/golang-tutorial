## Golang Learning
This repository contains my golang learning codes. I am following this book `Get Programming with Go` by `Nathan Youngman` and `Roger Pepp√©`

This book contains 7 units. 

1. Unit 1: Imperative Programming
2. Unit 2: Types
3. Unit 3: Building Blocks
4. Unit 4: Collections
5. Unit 5: State and Behavior
6. Unit 6: Down the Gopher Hole
7. Unit 7: Concurrent Programming

#### How To run any sample code?
Run this command `./run.sh <file_path>`

I will try to organize the sample codes by each unit. 

Happy Learning. Get ready, get, set, `Go!`
